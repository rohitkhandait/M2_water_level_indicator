# Description
 # Abstract:

A Water Level Indicator is used to detect and indicate the water level in a tank or any other water container. We investigated the design of a water level sensor device using Atmega328, that can detect the level of water in a water storage system. An ultrasonic sensor is used to generate ultrasonic waves, a water sensor to detect the water level, LEDs to signify the importance of different water levels, PC to observe the levels of water. We indicated a green LED for safe water level, one red LED for about to reach max level.
# Features

Save Power: In an era of energy conservation, these devices are very beneficial to save energy. Hence electrical power wastage can be reduced. These sensor control water levels and minimize the usage of electricity
Automatically works: These sensors can work automatically when connected to timer devices.
These are low cost and easy to install devices
The design is compact and with low maintenance and cam clearly indicate the water levels in the overhead tank
AS they can be fully automatic, they save time and avoid seepage of roofs and walls due to overflowing tanks.
These sensors take less energy and can be used for continuous operation

# Components
 ## Atmega328
The ATmega328 is a microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family.
It has a improved Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.
It has  32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers.
## Water level sensor
 WaterLevel sensors are used to detect the level of water. In place of water we can use liquids, slurries, granular material and powders. For measurement of Level we have to keep water inside the container.
    
 ## Connecting wires
   
Connecting wires allows an electrical current to travel from one point on a circuit to another because electricity needs a medium.
 ## LED lights
 An electrical current passes through a microchip, which illuminates the tiny light sources we call LEDs and the result is visible light.
       
 ## potentiometer
    A potentiometer is nothing but a three-terminal resistor with a rotating or sliding contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.
   
 ## Resistors
A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit.
